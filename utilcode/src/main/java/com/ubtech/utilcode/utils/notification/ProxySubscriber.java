 * are ProxySubscribers and if the object to be unsubscribed is the ProxySubscriber's proxiedSubscriber. If so, the
 * EventService proxy is unsubscribed and the ProxySubscriber's proxyUnsubscribed() method is called to allow the proxy
 * to perform any cleanup if necessary.  ProxySubscribers should set their references to their proxied objects to null
 * for strong subscriptions to allow garbage collection.
